#  What is Instantiation in terms of OOP terminology? 

"""

In object-oriented programming (OOP), instantiation is the process of creating an instance (or object) of a class.

Simplified Explanation:

Instantiation means creating a specific object from a class blueprint.

Example: If Person is a class, then creating a Person object like person1 = Person("Kaushik", 22) is instantiation.


Instantiation turns a class definition into a usable object with specific attributes and methods.
