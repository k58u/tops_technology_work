# How will you remove last object from a list? 
# Suppose list1 is [2, 33, 222, 14, and 25], what is list1 [-1]? 
'''
To remove the last object from a list in Python,
you can use the pop() method. This method removes and returns the last element of the list.

example
list1 = [5, 52, 22, 17, 37]
list1.pop()
print(list1) 
'''
list1 = [5, 52, 22, 17, 37]
print(list1[-1])
